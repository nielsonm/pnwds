The Drupal Way:

  Pro:
    Write minimal code
      Feeds, Rules, Entities
    Easily modified
    Fully integrated

  Con:
    Difficult to manage complex interactions
    Implementation scattered across modules
    Performance challenges

The coder way:

  Pro:
    Write fast code
    Build useful API for other modules
    Manage complex interactions in code
  Con:
    Must expose data in order to intergrate
    UI

  Be flexible - easy wins are worth it.
  json decoding is in core.

Now what?
  Store
    Entity or table
  Display
    As part of a node or page
    Dynamically with js

Security
  SSL
  http basic authorization
  Domain keys/subdomains
  OAuth

drupal http request is synchronous, use reasonable timeout value, cache is possible.
