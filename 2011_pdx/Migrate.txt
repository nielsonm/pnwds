Migrate with Drewish

Concepts:

  Source
  Destination
    Interface to Drupal data - typically entities
    Creates one record for each record in the source
    Needs to elucidate the dependencies
  Map
    Provides lookup facilities, in case of
  Field Mapping
    How to go from column x to field y.
    Split subfields
  Field Handlers
    Converts field into something Drupal understands
  Migration
    prepareRow(), prepare(), complete()

  Migrate Extra is a contrib, kind of YMMV, not as well supported as Migrate.

  Mangling in prepare()
    Great spot to merge, split fields from one version to the other.

  Writing a field handler is not too tricky, but not reccommended.
  Wordpress migrate module uses migrate and is awesome, commerce migrate needs some work.
