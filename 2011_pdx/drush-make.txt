Drush make

Drush is a helper monkey and a shopping list built in one.

Site manifest

  Easy for devs to quickly get up to speed

  Can eliminate duplicate repos (optional)
    Encourages contributing back to the module (patches not hacks)

  Drush make is simplistic

Download type can be a file, git, get

Libraries can be inserted too. Big plus for contrib modules (jQueryUI) that usesexternal libraries.

Issues:

  - Deployment support
    Aegir helped drive drush make.

  - Drush pm-update doesn't write to .make.
  - External dependencies
  - D.O. distro packaging

The future of make

  drush pm-update needs an option to update the .make file

  Caching of downloads (squid is being used currently).
    Drush 5 caches downloads.

  Create a drush deploy standard.
