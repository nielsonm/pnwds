Media past:

  Emfield, Image field, file field

  Image cache in core (styles)
  File and image field in core

  Acquia and Drupal Gardens

Media present:

    Using views, cTools
    --Don't write, integrate

Media Future:

  Awesomesauce
  Media Roadmap  d.o/node/1281276
  File entity is the backend for Media.

  Media initiative :
    Increased communication for maintainers
    Weekly meetings on  #drupal-media
    Commitment as maintainers
    Get new people involved in the process.
    Palantir and Acquia welcome help on Media

  Core Media Initiative:
    Media Sprint at DrupalCon Denver - g.d.o/media

  Filestyles now moved to file entities.
  There is another way to style file entities

  Demo:
    Media
    File-entity
    Media browser selection - view library - views goodness
    Manage display - Renderede file - image cache presets as well as link and token - sweet
    Manage file display - first manage field display and then the media INSIDE the field.
    Views integration is not currently using fields.
    Field settings let's admins turn off media browser plugins e.g. editors only want authors to use existing media on site - turn off the upload plugin.
    Legacy Media modules will be supported but not reccomended.
    2.x branch is great but still in development.
    Editing media is now in admin/media/list
    Media replace is a module that will replace old versions of a file with revisions.
