Contextual administration
Jesse Hofmann-Smith

Jesse fell into using CA.

Ease of use is king in creating an admin menu.

Not just a label - Fashion designers register for an account

  Two roles - Designer/Label and Blog Author/Editor

  Structure
    Lookbooks and blogs

  What do we need?
    Blog editors need an admin section to manage blogs

  Page manager creates custom pages, passes arguments to views, panels, etc.

  Views bulk operation module creates a admin interface that is really a view.

  VBO is broken right now with CA, but there should be a fix soon.
